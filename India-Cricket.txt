India vs Australia
==================

In the 2023 World Cup match between India and Australia, India emerged victorious with a six-wicket win, chasing down Australia's target of 199 in Chennai. Despite a shaky start with India at 2 for 3, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul steadied the ship with a partnership of 165. Kohli scored 85, and Rahul was left unbeaten at 97 as India reached the target.

Australia's innings was dominated by Ravindra Jadeja's exceptional bowling, taking 3 wickets for 28 runs. Jadeja, along with spinners Kuldeep Yadav and R Ashwin, created a chokehold with 16.5 overs of dot balls. Australia struggled to combat the turn, leading to a total of 199 all out.

David Warner surpassed 1000 ODI World Cup runs, but wickets fell regularly, including Steven Smith and Marnus Labuschagne. Glenn Maxwell and Cameron Green attempted a partnership, but their dismissals reduced Australia to 140 for 7. Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins added late runs, but the innings concluded at 199.

In India's chase, Kohli and Rahul showcased their experience, overcoming the early setbacks. Kohli's half-century and Rahul's 97 not out guided India to victory. Hazlewood's early strikes had put India in a challenging position, but the low target allowed them to recover without taking undue risks.

Kohli's dismissal, 15 runs short of a century, didn't hinder India's progress as they comfortably achieved the target with a sprint finish. Hardik Pandya and Rahul hit crucial sixes, securing a convincing win by 52 deliveries. Despite Rahul missing a century, India's professional performance and the sizable victory provided a positive start to their World Cup campaign.
